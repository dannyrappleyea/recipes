Trying to create a perfect small breakfast. These are potato and bacon.

# Ingredients
* 1/2 batch [rough puff pastry](rough%20puff%20pastry.md)
* small pack bacon
* small onion
* 3 small potatoes
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese (estimate)
* 2-3 eggs

# Directions
* Roll out pastry in tart pans, blind bake
* Cut the bacon into 1/2"-1" pieces. Throw it all in a pan and cook, separating bacon pieces. Drain on paper towels.
* Chop onion and grate potatoes. Start cooking onion in some bacon grease, adding potatos and cooking like hash browns, letting the bottom get brown before stirring.
* Assemble tarts. Add bacon, potatoes, then cheese to each tart pan. Beat eggs together and add a little to each pan as a binder.
* Bake at 400â„‰ for about 10 minutes, until nicely browned on top.
