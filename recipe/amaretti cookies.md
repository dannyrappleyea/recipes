# Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups almond flour
* 1 cup sugar or other sweetener
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3 large egg whites
* 1/8 cup milk
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* 1 tbsp amaretto
* 1/3 cup powdered sugar

# Directions
1) Preheat the oven to 325℉. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
2) Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl with a large whisk. Add almond extract, amaretto, and milk and whish to combine.
3) Beat the egg whites on med-high speed until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites into almond mixture carefully to keep as much air as possible.
4) Put the powdered sugar in a small bowl. Use a cookie scoop to measure dough, roll into a ball, then roll in the sugar, patting each down on cookie sheet.
5) Bake until pale golden brown, about 15–20 minutes.
6) Let cool 5 minutes before moving to cooling rack.

# Notes
* The amount of egg whites seems totally inadaquate for the amount of almond flour.
* Tried adding 1/8 cup milk with almond extract (before egg whites). Helps, but adds about 10 minutes to the cooking time.
