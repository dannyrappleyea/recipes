# Intro
A great way to combine veggies and buffalo sauce.

# Ingredients
-   4 medium zucchini or elongated summer squash (about 2 pounds total)
-   3 medium scallions
-   4 ounces mild cheddar cheese, shredded
-   15-oz can chickpeas    
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 tsp kosher salt, divided
-   1 tsp garlic powder, divided
-   1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
-   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
-   1/3 cup hot sauce, such as Frank’s RedHot
-   1/4 cupranch or blue cheese dressing

# Directions
1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 400°F.
2.  Cut 4 medium zucchini in half lengthwise, no need to trim the ends. Using a small spoon or melon baller, carefully scoop out the flesh of the zucchini, leaving a 1/4-inch thick shell to form zucchini boats (discard the flesh or freeze for smoothies). Wipe off any excess moisture on the zucchini with paper towels and place cut-side up to a rimmed baking sheet.
3.  Thinly slice 3 medium scallions, keeping the white and light green parts separate from the dark green parts. Grate 3 ounces sharp cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 3/4 cup). Drain and rinse 1 can chickpeas.
4.  Place 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl and whisk with a fork to combine. Brush into the wells of the zucchini boats, flip the boats so they’re cut-side down, and brush onto the backs. Bake on the lower rack until the zucchini are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
5.  Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the scallion white and light green parts, remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the chickpeas and 1/3 cup hot sauce and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is bubbling and thickened slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from heat.
6.  Flip the zucchini cut-side up and immediately sprinkle half the cheese into the boats. Spoon the chickpeas into the boats, packing them in tightly (2 to 3 tablespoons per boat). Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
7.  Bake on the upper rack until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the zucchini is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle with 1/4 cup ranch or blue cheese dressing and top with the scallion greens

# Notes
- Need more cheese than that
